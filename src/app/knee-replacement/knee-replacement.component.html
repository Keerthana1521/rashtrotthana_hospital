            What is Total Knee Replacement (TKR)?
        </div>
        <div class="content-1">
            Total Knee Replacement (TKR) is a surgical procedure designed to relieve knee pain and improve function by replacing the damaged parts of the knee joint with artificial components. This surgery involves removing damaged cartilage and bone from the knee and replacing it with prosthetic implants made of metal, high-grade plastics and polymers. TKR surgery is a highly effective solution for those suffering from severe knee pain, helping them regain mobility and improve their quality of life.

            Why Choose Total Knee Replacement?
        </div>
        <div class="content-2">
            TKR surgery is typically recommended for individuals who experience chronic knee pain that interferes with daily activities and does not respond to nonsurgical treatments. While it is most commonly performed on patients aged 60 and older, younger patients with severe knee damage due to arthritis or injury can also benefit from the procedure. Candidates for TKR often suffer from:
        </div><br>
        <div class="content-2">
            <ul>
                <li>Severe knee pain that limits daily activities such as walking, climbing stairs, and sitting or rising from chairs.</li>
                <li>Moderate or severe knee pain while resting, both day and night.</li>
                <li>Chronic knee inflammation and swelling that doesn’t improve with rest or medications.</li>
                <li>Knee deformity, where there is a noticeable arching in or out of the knee.</li>
                <li>No significant relief from other knee pain treatments such as physical therapy, medications, or injections.</li>
                <li>Various knee pain causes such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, post-traumatic arthritis, injury and overuse.</li>

            TKR surgery is recommended when other treatments for knee pain have failed to provide relief. This includes:
